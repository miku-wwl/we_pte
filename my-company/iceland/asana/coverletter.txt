Dear Hiring Team,

I am thrilled to apply for the Senior Software Engineer role on Asana's Frameworks team in Reykjavík.

Technical Alignment with Asana's Goals

Given my deep familiarity with the JVM ecosystem through Java, I am eager to leverage this foundation to adopt Scala and GraphQL—technologies.

Excitement for Reykjavík and Asana's Culture
I am writing to request your assistance in obtaining a work visa and relocating to Iceland, and I am fully prepared to promptly supply all necessary documentation for these procedures.
I am genuinely fascinated by Iceland’s unique cultural heritage and stunning natural landscapes, and I eagerly look forward to collaborating with your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available at your convenience for an interview and can be reached at (+86) 15195863766 or weilai.ire@outlook.com.
