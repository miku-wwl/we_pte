Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Software Engineer position.

My core strength lies in addressing technical challenges in low-latency, high-throughput environments, with hands-on experience in microservices development using Kubernetes.

I have hands-on experience with Aeron and RocketMQ, and am familiar with Thrift/IDC interface design. This experience directly aligns with the requirements for game servers to manage player message communication and state synchronization efficiently.
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your diverse and talented team:

Fluent in English
Deep passion for game development
Aligned with Iceland’s collaborative work culture, and if given the opportunity, I am prepared to fully align with the team’s workflow to help drive the technical evolution of EVE Online.
Sincerely,
Weilai Wang
