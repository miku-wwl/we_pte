Bókun
Reykjavík, Iceland

Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer position at Bókun.

Technical Expertise
My professional background centers on Java development, with deep proficiency in the Spring Boot/Spring Cloud ecosystem—technologies that directly map to your backend stack. With extensive experience in troubleshooting and diagnosing Java-based systems, I am confident in my ability to excel in this role.

I also bring hands-on frontend experience with React/Next.js, having developed a full-stack image hosting website (https://github.com/miku-wwl/we_image) that integrates Amazon S3 storage and Docker deployment.

Passion for Travel Tech
The thing I love most about Bókun is your dedication to helping travel operators worldwide with user-friendly and effective tech. I am eager to apply this expertise to continuously improve my own technical skills and solve real-world challenges in travel, such as optimizing booking workflows or improving operational scalability for tour operators.

Cultural Fit
Based in Beijing, I’ve collaborated with global teams at Huawei (Most are Israeli engineers) and thrive in diverse environments. I’ll need visa sponsorship for relocation.
I’m ready to adapt to Iceland’s work culture and thrive in a global, inclusive environment.

Sincerely,
Weilai Wang
