Helsinki

Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Full Stack Developer role at Reaktor.

I possess comprehensive full-stack development capabilities, with years of experience in developing using Java, React, and Typescript.

My professional background focuses primarily on back-end-centric full-stack development. I have participated in the development of the high-throughput, low-latency system by using Aeron, and am familiar with the use of message queues (such as RocketMQ) and RPC frameworks (such as Thrift). Additionally, I have hands-on experience in microservices development based on Kubernetes, enabling me to build distributed system architectures that support high availability and scalability.

What excites me most is Reaktor's flexible, open, and technology-agnostic work environment. I believe that with my passion for technology, pursuit of world-class development practices, and ability to quickly adapt to different technology stacks, I can seamlessly integrate into your team and make valuable contributions.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills align with Reaktor’s innovative projects.

Sincerely,
Weilai Wang
